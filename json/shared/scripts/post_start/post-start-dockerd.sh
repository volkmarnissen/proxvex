# The pre-baked debian-docker base image (oci/debian-docker/Dockerfile)
# ships docker.io + docker-cli but no init system — debian:trixie-slim
# is too minimal for systemd, and OCI-derived LXC rootfs aren't designed
# to run an init anyway. So we launch dockerd directly via nohup.
#
# THIS IS THE ONLY DOCKERD STARTER. Its template (307-post-start-dockerd.json)
# runs with `execute_on: "hook"`, which deploys this very file into
# /etc/proxvex/on_start.d/ *and* runs it once right away. One script therefore
# covers both moments: the deploy (install/upgrade/reconfigure) and every later
# container start, including after a host reboot. Until 2026-10 a second,
# near-identical copy of this logic was generated host-side by
# conf-write-dockerd-on-start.sh via a two-part heredoc — 54 of its 55 code
# lines were word-identical with this file, which is exactly how two copies
# start to drift.
#
# Idempotent: a second run notices dockerd already on its socket and
# exits 0, so post_start replays after rollback don't double-start.

# Launch dockerd, then WATCH IT until it answers — and start it again whenever
# it dies on the way.
#
# Fire-and-forget is not enough, and the failure is a real one (ubuntupve,
# 2026-10-02): a host reboot started eight containers at once, dockerd's
# embedded containerd needed 8.99 s to boot in one of them, dockerd's internal
# wait expired first and the daemon exited:
#
#   containerd successfully booted in 8.994800s
#   failed to start containerd: timeout waiting for containerd to start
#
# Nothing retried, so two of four containers came up with no Docker at all and
# stayed that way until someone noticed. The containers themselves were fine —
# their restart policies brought all 20 back the moment dockerd ran — so
# dockerd is the only part that needs to be robust here.
#
# That timeout (~15 s) lives inside dockerd and is not exposed in daemon.json,
# so the lever is restarting rather than waiting longer. The first version of
# this block waited a blind 60 s and retried ONCE, assuming contention passes
# quickly (measured minutes later: containerd up in 18 ms). On 2026-10-24 that
# was not enough: after a host reboot six containers started at load 9+, and
# in one of them dockerd died twice in a row (start 04:14:33, dead after 16 s;
# the blind wait idled on until 04:15:47; the retry died after 15 s again) and
# the hook gave up — while a manual start at 04:23 booted containerd in 0.5 s.
# In another container the single retry happened to succeed, but dockerd then
# needed 3 min 40 s until its API answered.
#
# So instead of counting attempts we watch the process:
#   - poll `docker info` every 2 s;
#   - if the dockerd we started has exited, clear the stale pid/sock files and
#     start it again after a growing pause (5, 10, 20, 40, then 60 s) — the
#     pause lets the host's start storm drain instead of joining it;
#   - no restart is begun after DOCKERD_START_BUDGET seconds (default 300);
#   - a dockerd that is still ALIVE is never killed: it may just be slow to
#     initialise under load, so it gets up to DOCKERD_ALIVE_MAX seconds
#     (default 600) in total before the hook reports failure.
# A progress line goes out every 30 s, because the deployer runs this hook
# with an idle timeout (2 min of silence) when it triggers it at deploy time.
#
# nohup + setsid so dockerd survives the SSH/pct exec session that launched it.
# stdout/stderr → log file; stdin → /dev/null. PID is reaped by the LXC's PID 1.
#
# Surviving the session is not enough — dockerd must not INHERIT it either.
# `pct exec` passes the caller's environment through, and an ssh login on the
# host carries XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/0. dockerd hands it to containerd and
# runc, and runc puts its exec state files there. The LXC has no logind, so
# /run/user/0 never exists, and from then on EVERY `docker exec` fails with
#   OCI runtime exec failed: open /run/user/0/runc-process…: no such file
# while `docker ps`, `up` and the running containers look perfectly healthy
# (found 2026-10-02 in heimvio-green: dockerd and containerd both carried
# XDG_SESSION_ID=18 from the session that had restarted them). Drop the
# session variables so a start from a login shell equals a start at boot.
