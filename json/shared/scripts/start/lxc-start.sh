# then exit signalling switchover_scheduled so the orchestrator marks all

# startup fails intermittently: a docker-compose app can't resolve its DB
# ("server misbehaving"), a cloudflared tunnel can't reach the edge. Unlike
# the self-upgrade fast-path above we do NOT switchover-skip the remaining
# steps — post_start (docker-compose up) must still run on NEW and replace_ct
# then destroys the already-stopped OLD. We only need OLD off the wire first.
#
# Scope: static ip= only. DHCP clones get a fresh lease and never collide, so
# `ip=dhcp` (NEW_IP stays empty) leaves this untouched and the old behaviour
# (OLD keeps running through the phases) is preserved — which is what the
# livetest suite exercises. STOPPED_PREV is checked in the failure paths below
