# Clone an existing LXC container for reconfigure.
#
# Steps:
# 1) Verify source container exists and was created by proxvex.
# 2) Determine target VMID (explicit, vm_id_start-based, or next free).
# 3) Clone source to target using vzdump + pct restore.
# 4) Output target VMID, source VMID, and installed addons.
#
# Inputs (templated):
#   - previous_vm_id (required)
#   - vm_id (optional target id)
#   - vm_id_start (optional start index for auto-assigned IDs)
#
# Output:
#   - JSON to stdout with vm_id, previous_vm_id, installed_addons
