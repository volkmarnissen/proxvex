# Restore container settings from a previous container during upgrade.
# Reads the old container's LXC config and applies preserved settings to
# the newly created container.
#
# Restored entries:
#   - net0                (static IP, bridge, hwaddr, gw) via pct set
#   - hostname            via pct set
#   - nameserver          via pct set
#   - lxc.environment:    addon-managed ENV vars (OIDC, SSL, ...) appended
#                         directly to the new config file; lxc.environment.runtime:
#                         lines are NOT touched (they come from the image).
#
# Without this step the new container loses everything that addons appended
# to the old config — static IP falls back to DHCP, OIDC env vars are gone,
# etc. — and the upgraded container appears "half-initialized".

# Requires:
#   - previous_vm_id: Old container ID whose config to read
#   - vm_id: New container ID to apply settings to

# --- Restore addon-managed volume mount points (mp[0-9]+) ------------------
# During upgrade, oci-image's create_ct creates a fresh container with only
# the base volumes (config + secure for proxvex). Addon-managed volumes
# (e.g. certs + proxvex from addon-ssl) live on the old container's mp2/mp3
# and never get migrated — the upgrade flow does not re-run addon templates,
# and ADDON_VOLUMES is empty when 150-conf-create-storage-volumes-for-lxc.sh
# runs during the upgrade's create_ct phase. Result: the new container is
# missing /etc/ssl/addon, dockerd-style services find no certs at start, and
# HTTPS does not come up.
#
# Fix: iterate the old config's managed mp* entries, copy each underlying
# volume to a new-vmid-prefixed name (vol_copy preserves data via zfs
# send|recv / dd / cp), and add an mp* entry to the new container at the
# same mountpoint. Bind mounts (mp[N]: /...) and entries whose key already
# exists on the new container are left alone.
